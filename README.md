# HTML + CSS project
This is my first HTML + CSS project - 19 page website.
Just use Live Server to run it.

Some reservations:
- naming (classes, id's) is not so good because I was inexperienced;
- I made the nesting of tags too large in some cases. While it was possible to get by with only one container;
- adaptive layout is implemented on the main page only due to the time limit;
- I used some old libraries (such as jQuery) to add some interactivity to pages. Please ignore it because this project was not about Javascript.
